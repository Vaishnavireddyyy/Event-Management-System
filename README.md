## 📋 Project Overview  
The Event Management System is a database-driven application designed to streamline the organization and management of events. It provides functionalities to efficiently handle event details, participant registrations, venue bookings, and scheduling. This system aims to reduce manual effort, minimize errors, and improve the overall coordination of events by centralizing data and automating processes.

## ❓ Problem Statement  
Managing multiple events manually involves complex coordination, frequent errors, and difficulties in tracking participants and resources. Without a centralized database, event organizers face challenges in updating event details, managing registrations, and allocating venues efficiently. The problem is to design a reliable database management system that supports smooth event planning and execution.

## 💡 Solution  
Our solution is a robust database system that stores all relevant event information such as event details, participant data, venue information, and schedules. It allows authorized users to add, update, delete, and retrieve event data quickly. Through well-defined database schemas and queries, the system ensures data consistency, integrity, and easy access, thereby facilitating efficient event management.
